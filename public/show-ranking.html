<h3>10. Billions</h3>
<p>
  Set primarily in New York and Connecticut, the series depicts hedge fund
  manager Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis) as he accumulates wealth and power in the
  world of high finance.[3][4] Axelrod's aggressive tactics frequently garner
  the attention of United States Attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti). Rhoades
  is based on Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern
  District of New York in Manhattan from 2009 to 2017, and the series was
  inspired by real-life federal prosecutions of financial crime.[5][6] Bharara's
  2013 prosecution of hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen of S.A.C. Capital
  Advisors loosely influenced the first season, while Salomon Brothers' 1991
  manipulation of U.S. Treasury bonds inspired the second.[7] Series subplots
  feature the psychiatrist turned performance coach Wendy Rhoades (Maggie Siff),
  market analyst Taylor Mason (Asia Kate Dillon), and Axelrod's right-hand man
  Mike "Wags" Wagner (David Costabile).
